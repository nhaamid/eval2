    Jamestown Public Library</a>
    <p>When looking at websites it is important to anyone looking to get it web development to analyzing websites for their effectiveness. This is important as it helps us to not worry about any gaps that we could have between our knowledge of the best practices or the many theories that underly UX research and designing. For this essay, I will be analyzing the Jamestown Public Library Website in order to determine its effectiveness by looking at the different components of the website, the
    tasks I think that the website was created to facilitate, and if the components of this site make completing those tasks easier for the users</p>
    <p>We will examine the different components the make up this website. The first thing is the home page that has multiple different tabs that will link you to different parts of the site as well as each of these tabs having a drop-down menu when you would hover them. Below the tabs is a picture of the Jamestown Public Library and next to it is the Hours of Operation for the library and below that are tabs for Curbside Pickup, Search Catalog, eBooks, and NC Kids eBooks. Finally, below that is pictures of many new adult titles that are available and below that is a calendar with the different events for the library.</p>
    <p>One of the main tasks that I believe that this site was created to facilitate was to have a way to for anyone in the public to be able to access the information and resources that the Jamestown public library has at their disposal without having to physically go to the library in person if they’re not in the area or don’t have time to be there. This way if a person living in Jamestown needed information for an article or book, they can more easily find it without the need to be in person or be able to know what their looking for when they get to the library as well. This site makes it easier for the users to also keep track of the resources that are currently available and where they are as well.</p2>
    <p>For the final question, I do think that the components of this site make it easy for the users that need to use it for any of their needs when going through Jamestown Public Library site. The Catalog that’s you have a much more detailed way to search for the resources that you need but the main for it can be a little bit confusing to some. It also makes it easy for people who are not looking for books and articles, by letting people be able to rent rooms if they what to have a study session with friends. Also, the layout of the site itself makes it easier for users to navigate without getting lost as you only have to scroll up and down.</p>
    <p>I overall believe that this site is great at facilitating the task of allowing residents to have more easy access and get a hold of any resources that the library provides without having to leave their homes in a clear and organized way. It also can provide a way to keep up with events people in the area may be interested in. It is a well put together public library site with little to no issues that is much more then information on books as well as hosting events and renting rooms that make it a easier time for people to do what they need at the library remotely.</p>
